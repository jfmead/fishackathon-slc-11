        <p>You can do anything your heart can imagine. There it is. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them.<br><br>

If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. In this world, everything can be happy. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown.<br><br>

Happy painting, God bless. Let your imagination be your guide. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look.<br><br>

We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things We have a fantastic little sky! That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear.<br><br>

With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. You're meant to have fun in life. Let the paint work. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them.<br><br>

This piece of canvas is your world. Very easy to work these to death. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. We need dark in order to show light.<br><br>

It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Let your imagination be your guide. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens.</p>
